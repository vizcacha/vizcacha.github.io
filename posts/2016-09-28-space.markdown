If you continue to study mathematics past calculus, you will be bombarded by a zoo of mathematical spaces.

The word *space* by itself is never really defined; it can be taken to be a synonym for set.
Typically, a space consists of a set of points along with some kind of structure.
That structure can come in many different forms.

## Algebraic spaces

There are a lot of different algebraic structures we could give a set.
Despite lacking the term space in their names, groups, rings, fields, and related objects certainly satisfy the definition above.
For our purposes, we will start with the *vector space*.
Vector spaces (sometimes also called linear spaces) consist of a field $K$ along with a set of vectors $V$.
We often say $V$ is a vector space over $K$.

## Topological spaces

## Metric spaces

## Banach, Hilbert, and Fock spaces
